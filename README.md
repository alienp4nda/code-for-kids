## Purpose
My kids want to learn how to code and I want to teach them.  There's plenty of tutorials out there that state they're for begginers but gloss over concepts I believe need to be explained more simplistic for kids.  My approach for this repo is to write tutorials aimed at kids 8-12 years of age.
