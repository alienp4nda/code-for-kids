Imagine a variable is like a box that can hold different things, like toys or snacks. In programming, a variable is a special kind of box that holds information like numbers or words. We give each box a name, like "score" or "name," so we can use it to remember and change information while we're writing computer programs. It's like having different boxes to store different things in a game or a story!
