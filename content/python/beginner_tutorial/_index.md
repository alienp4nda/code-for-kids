A programmer writes code in a programming language to create programs. Many programs must be  "compiled". This means that another computer program, called a compiler, translates the source code into machine code.

Computer programs must be written very carefully. If the programmer makes mistakes the program might then "crash" or stop working. When a program has a problem because of how the code was written, this is called a "bug". A very small mistake can cause a very big problem. 

Throughout this tutorial you will see code written in blocks like the one below.

```python
# This is a comment in a code block
print("This is code in the code block")
```

In order to learn coding it is best not just read this text but to write the code and run it. We will be using [Thonny](https://thonny.org). Write the code in this tutorial into Thonny and then run it to see what the code does, do not copy and paste the code.

If you struggle with a section write down what you know and then write a question about what you don't understand. Afterwards, re-read that section and see if you can answer your question. If you can answer your question write it down, otherwise ask for help. Once you're done with a section we will go over what you learned and what you still don't understand.
