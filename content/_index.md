# Basic Programming Concepts
A programming language is a type of written language that tells computers what to do in order to work. Programming languages are used to make all the computer programs and computer software. A programming language is like a set of instructions that the computer follows to do something.

A programmer writes code in a programming language to create programs. Many programs must be  "compiled". This means that another computer program, called a compiler, translates the source code into another language.

Computer programs must be written very carefully. If the programmer makes mistakes the program might then "crash" or stop working. When a program has a problem because of how the code was written, this is called a "bug". A very small mistake can cause a very big problem.
